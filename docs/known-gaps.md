# Known gaps

This is the maintained gap index. A missing item is not automatically supported;
current status must be backed by tests and evidence.

LLVM 21 miner coverage remains partial: [compressed secp256k1 now passes](experiments/llvm21-guarded-load.md)
with bounded equality/OR guard proofs. [The uncompressed sibling and eight address checks](experiments/llvm21-address-checks.md)
also pass; the full suite and mining workloads are still unvalidated. Arbitrary predicate implications remain unsupported.

[Discarded tuple halves](experiments/llvm21-discarded-half.md) are handled for
single-consumer, same-block pack/extract pairs with unchanged selected sources.
More general partial-value definedness remains unsupported.

## Highest-priority open work

1. Expand typed CuMetal IR beyond the now-matched reviewed compile corpus and
   broaden numerical coverage.
2. Establish a recurring verification mechanism outside GitHub Actions and
   commission the trusted Apple-GPU lane; the fixed 185-test Phase 4 denominator
   is now defined.
3. Validate genuinely distinct supported Xcode toolchains.
4. Finish runtime/library semantic matrices and bounded binary-container forms.

The named five-kernel Phase 5 release set is closed for its selected-set
criterion; broader performance claims remain explicitly out of scope.
The [matmul study](matmul-performance.md) measures a remaining custom FP32
CUDA-kernel gap to MPS; its source-tile optimization is not an automatic
compiler optimization or evidence of M1/NVIDIA performance. A separate
[bounded private-array compiler pass](compiler-performance.md) targets large
per-thread arrays; it does not automatically retile kernels or provide MPS parity.

The executable priority/evidence table is in
[the specification closure roadmap](spec-closure-roadmap.md).

PTX recursive device calls remain unsupported except for the strictly checked
scalar and read-all / replace-all local-buffer tail-self-call forms documented
in the [miner fix backlog](experiments/miner-fix-backlog.md). General local-frame
recursion and barrier-aware trap cancellation remain open; the bounded LLVM 19 xoroshiro
fallback now passes numerical validation.

Vector parameter-slot transfers support the checked unpredicated direct-slot
`v2.b64` form. Other vector parameter forms fail explicitly; register-indirect
vector loads are not expanded because destination/address aliasing needs
separate handling.

[Bounded kernel trap reporting](experiments/trap-reporting.md) supports unchanged
PTX in kernels and supported acyclic device-call graphs without user barriers/collectives.
Trapping/looping helpers expand into the cancellation CFG; proven finite helpers
can remain calls. Expansion-size limits and unknown builtin restrictions remain. It reports a
stream-level software launch failure; full context-abort semantics and arbitrary
precompiled trap ABI are not implemented.

PTX pointer-minus-64-bit-integer byte offsets preserve pointer address spaces,
including local reverse loops. Pointer differences, integer-minus-pointer, and
narrow pointer subtraction remain explicitly rejected. Both pinned base58
primitive self-tests now pass; full mining kernels remain unvalidated. See the
[miner fix backlog](experiments/miner-fix-backlog.md).

The [complete miner self-test sweep](experiments/miner-self-test-sweep-6d2549b.md)
recorded 64 compile failures on `6d2549b`: 47 trap/call restrictions, 9 LLVM 19 SSA
definedness failures, and 8 LLVM 7 pointer/type failures. All 174 launched entries
pass, including two plumbing probes; this does not establish arithmetic
coverage for constant-folded fixtures.

Since that sweep, bounded trap/call support clears the WIF compressed-mainnet
checks in both producers. The original compressed secp256k1 LLVM 19 self-test
now passes after parameter-store truncation and signed-byte `cvt` fixes.
Six smaller k256 checks also pass. LLVM 7's earlier 180-second runtime-attempt
timeout remains uninvestigated. These targeted results do not replace the full
historical ledger or validate other composed/mining kernels. See
[fix 12](experiments/miner-fix-backlog.md#fix-12-cvt-interprets-the-instructions-source-width)
and [targeted evidence](experiments/secp256k1-isolation.md).
The LLVM 19 uncompressed secp256k1, Ethereum-address and Bitcoin-encoded-address
entries also pass individually at `93ebd6b`. The remaining six Ethereum/Bitcoin
intermediate-field and matching-flag entries pass at `b4894ed`, so all eight
entries in that LLVM 19 group pass their fixed fixtures. Matching only covers a
positive `bc1q` prefix with an empty suffix. LLVM 7 counterparts, randomized and
negative matching cases, full-suite completion and mining kernels remain outside
this validation. See [results](experiments/address-intermediates.md).

Integer `cvt` reads the instruction's source width even when its operand occupies
a wider integer register: truncate first, then apply signed/unsigned conversion.
Exhaustive byte and randomized wider-register GPU cases guard against losing
the sign extension required for negative scalar digits.

Integer `st.param` stores truncate wider registers to the instruction width
before call/return ABI handling. Mismatched argument byte widths are rejected;
equal-width bit reinterpretations retain their semantics. See
[fix 11](experiments/miner-fix-backlog.md#fix-11-parameter-stores-preserve-their-instruction-width).
